## 

> Objectives

In this study, we explore the impact of dimensionality reduction and feature selection on improving both the interpretability and generalizability of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Our research evaluates how these techniques make black-box models more transparent while enhancing their performance across diverse network environments. 📊🔐

The findings of this study have significant implications for the field of cybersecurity. By offering a generalizable feature set, we aim to make IDS deployment more efficient, allowing for better detection across multiple networks with reduced setup complexity. 🌐✨<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compeleceng.2024.109627"> Read More...</a>
