		The objective of this work is to evaluate and compare various feature selection techniques in the context of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Specifically, the study aims to assess the impact of different univariate and multivariate filters on the performance of classification algorithms used in IDS. By conducting experiments on multiple intrusion detection datasets, the goal is to identify the most effective feature selection methods that can reduce dimensionality while maintaining or improving the classification efficiency, particularly in detecting cyber-attack scenarios. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00767-y"> Read More...</a>
