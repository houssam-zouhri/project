The aim of this research is to develop and evaluate a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) that combines Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) for generating synthetic data and a consistency-based feature selection method (CON) to address class imbalance and reduce feature dimensionality. The study benchmarks the performance of the CTGAN-generated data against traditional oversampling techniques like SMOTE and ADASYN, using the CIC-IDS2018 dataset. By testing various machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks), the research seeks to determine the effectiveness of synthetic data and feature selection in improving intrusion detection accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. The findings highlight the superior performance of the XGBoost classifier with CTGAN-generated data, achieving near-perfect detection rates with reduced feature sets and demonstrating the viability of synthetic data in intrusion detection tasks.<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/WCCS62745.2024.10765501"> Read More...</a>
